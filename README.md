# Design Patterns in PHP
The most important design patterns rewritten from Java to PHP 7 (in my case 7.3).

The idea behind this repository is to show the best ways to use the design patterns in PHP. Some problems can be resolved in different ways, but the idea is the same. 

For the moment, the following design patterns are added to the repository:
* [Builder](https://github.com/bulbulica2/designpatternsphp/tree/master/Builder)
* [Singleton](https://github.com/bulbulica2/designpatternsphp/tree/master/Singleton)

People are always saying that PHP is a low level programming language but from 7.4 it became a strong type language that can become a very powerful tool nowadays.
